Considerations and Next Steps:

- This sentence uses "therefore" as a connection between two ideas
- In Japanese, we often use から (kara) to show cause and effect
- The first part describes a state (being cold) in a location
- The second part describes an action that needs to be done
- Consider how to express "need to" in Japanese - this is often done with なければなりません
- The word order will be different from English, with the verb coming at the end

You can:

- Try forming the first part about it being cold
- Ask about how to connect two ideas with "therefore"
- Ask about how to express "need to" in Japanese
- Make an attempt at the full sentence
